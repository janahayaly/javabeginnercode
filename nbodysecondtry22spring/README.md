/**********************************************************************
 *  Please list all help, collaboration, and outside resources

 *  If you did not get any help in outside of TA office hours,
 *  and did not use any materials outside of the standard
 *  course materials and piazza, write the following statement below:
 *  "I did not receive any help outside of TA office hours.  I
 *  did not collaborate with anyone, and I did not use any
 *  resources beyond the standard course materials."

 *  "I did not receive any help outside of TA office hours.  I
 *  did not collaborate with anyone, and I did not use any
 *  resources beyond the standard course materials."

/**********************************************************************
 *  Problem A: 
 *  Compare this approach to the approach in HW2. Why is it better to 
 *  decompose a problem using objects?
 **********************************************************************/

This makes it more organized because instead of accessing the information about the
bodies in arrays which group them by characteristic, we have the characteristics of
the body actually associated with it. That way, we can access them more easily and 
call them in different functions and even across classes.


/**********************************************************************
 *  Describe any serious problems you encountered.                    
 **********************************************************************/

No serious problems.

/**********************************************************************
 *  Difficulty - Very Difficult, Somewhat Difficult, Somewhat Easy, 
 *  Very Easy (you may add comments alongside your rating).                                   
 **********************************************************************/

Somewhat Difficult/Easy: it made it easier that we had done NBody before, so I had 
some idea of where to start. However, it was harder to debug since I was less 
familiar with it and did not know how to do small things like use print statements
on objects (static vs non-static).

/**********************************************************************
 *  Quality of the Write-up - Very Good, Somewhat Good, Somewhat Bad, 
 *  Very Bad (you may add comments alongside your rating).                                 
 **********************************************************************/

Very Good: it was very thorough and easy to follow, even though I went in super 
confused.

/**********************************************************************
 *  Quality of the Submission Tests: Very Good, Somewhat Good, 
 *  Somewhat Bad, Very Bad (you may add comments alongside your rating).                                
 **********************************************************************/

Somewhat Good: were good for the most part, but did not point out a common error in 
the simulate code- only found out it was buggy when I put it into Gradescope.

/**********************************************************************
 *  Did this assignment help you understand objects better? Helped 
 *  significantly, helped somewhat, barely helped, did not help at all.                                  
 **********************************************************************/

Helped significantly.
